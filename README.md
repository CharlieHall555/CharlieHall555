# Hey👋, I'm Charlie  

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m Charlie, a recent Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in software engineering, particularly within game development and digital education.

I began programming through game development in ROBLOX Studio, which sparked a long-term interest in building interactive systems and clean, maintainable software. Since then, I’ve expanded my skills across broader software development, including backend systems and application architecture.

Alongside my studies, I worked as a coding tutor, helping young learners develop programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills. Teaching has reinforced my belief in the importance of accessible, engaging digital education.

## 🎓 Education
- **BSc Computer Science (1st Class)** – University of Leicester  

## 🚧 What I’m Working On
- 🖥️ **Roblox Studio Environment Emulator with Luau Interpreter**  
- 🌐 **Web platform for learning Lua**  

## 🚀 Projects  

Here’s a selection of my projects. I’ll keep adding more here:  

- 🗳️ **Internet Voting System** – Developed for my final year project, using a custom blockchain to ensure transparent and secure voting.

- 🎮 **Spleef (Roblox Game)** – A fast-paced competitive game (inspired by the Minecraft original) where players destroy blocks beneath opponents to make them fall. Built using Roblox Studio and Luau scripting.  | 🔑 Source available on request  

- 📊 **Leaderboard API** – A FastAPI backend for global/weekly/monthly Roblox leaderboards with batch updates and database storage.
