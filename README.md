# Hey👋, I'm Charlie  

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm Charlie, a recent Computer Science graduate passionate about coding and ready to make a difference in the industry.  

When I first started programming, I focused on **game development in ROBLOX Studio**. Since then, I've explored various frameworks and developed a strong interest in **backend systems**, **networks**, and **cybersecurity**.  

I've always been passionate about **computer science** and **digital education**, even taking up tutoring during my studies. My current personal project is a **web platform to help people learn Lua**.  

Digital education is a space I truly care about and would love to continue contributing to in the future.  

## 🎓 Education
- **BSc Computer Science (1st Class)** – University of Leicester  

## 🚧 What I’m Working On
- 🖥️ **Roblox Studio Environment Emulator with Luau Interpreter**  
- 🌐 **Web platform for learning Lua**  

## 🚀 Projects  

Here’s a selection of my projects. I’ll keep adding more here:  

- 🗳️ **Internet Voting System** – Developed for my final year project, using a custom blockchain to ensure transparent and secure voting.

- 🎮 **Spleef (Roblox Game)** – A fast-paced competitive game (inspired by the Minecraft original) where players destroy blocks beneath opponents to make them fall. Built using Roblox Studio and Luau scripting.  | 🔑 Source available on request  

- 📊 **Leaderboard API** – A FastAPI backend for global/weekly/monthly Roblox leaderboards with batch updates and database storage.
